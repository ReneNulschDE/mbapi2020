# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Please send email to [secure-mbapi2020@nulsch.de](mailto:secure-mbapi2020@nulsch.de). 

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email and keep in mind this project is the hobby of one person.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, then this is the wrong project. I do not have a bug bounty programm.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English or German.
